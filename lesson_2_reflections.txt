What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, the zero state of the version control is set. This is the state from which git begins tracking any changes to any file in that directory. This is required as this is the very first step in running version control. The changes to the file would not be tracked if this wasn't done. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging aea is different in that it is not an actual directory. It is simply an in-between state which allows you see what files you are comitting. It gives you a chance to visually review what you are doing and a chance to cancel or amend which files you want to commit.
