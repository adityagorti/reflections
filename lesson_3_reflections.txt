When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If you are using different computers to work on a project or working with other users and need a centralized place to push all your changes,then a remote repository is much preferred to keeping your work local. 


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	This is so that you can decide which commits should be sent to the remote repository. If Git automatically updtaed, then changes/commits that you did not want to be made public or added to the remote repo would be.
